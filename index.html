<h1>A little Bit About Me</h1>
<p>I am a PNW native but last year I lived in a small suburb outside of Charlotte,North Carolina 
    for about 7 months. We moved there because my partner plays professional baseball and had an 
    opportunity to play there. When we were done I drove all the way back to Seattle solo and LOVED
    it. I currently work in professional development and community engagement for one of the largest retail companies in the 
    US. I enjoy working here but I am in this program to further develop my skills in the tech industry and 
    hopefully one day have more of an opportunity to have remote work.I wasn't sure what to link so I decided to link my protfolio since it shows a little 
    bit more about me both personally and professionally.
